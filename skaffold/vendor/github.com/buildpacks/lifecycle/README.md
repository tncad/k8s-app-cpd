# Lifecycle

![Build Status](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/workflows/build/badge.svg)
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle)

A reference implementation of the [Cloud Native Buildpacks specification](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec).

This lifecycle implements the following versioned APIs
* Buildpack API 0.2
* Platform API 0.3

## Commands

### Build

* `detector` - chooses buildpacks (via `/bin/detect`)
* `analyzer` - restores launch layer metadata from the previous build
* `restorer` - restores cache
* `builder` -  executes buildpacks (via `/bin/build`)
* `exporter` - creates image and stores cache

### Run

* `launcher` - invokes choice of process

### Rebase

* `rebaser` - remotely patches images with new base image

## Development
To test, build, and package binaries into an archive, simply run:

```bash
$ make all
```
This will create an archive at `out/lifecycle-<LIFECYCLE_VERSION>+linux.x86-64.tgz`.

By default, `LIFECYCLE_VERSION` is `0.0.0`. It can be changed by prepending `LIFECYCLE_VERSION=<some version>` to the
`make` command. For example:

```bash
$ LIFECYCLE_VERSION=1.2.3 make all
```

Steps can also be run individually as shown below.

### Test

Formats, vets, and tests the code.

```bash
$ make test
```

### Build

Builds binaries to `out/linux/lifecycle/`.

```bash
$ make build
```

> To clean the `out/` directory, run `make clean`.

### Package

Creates an archive at `out/lifecycle-<LIFECYCLE_VERSION>+linux.x86-64.tgz`, using the contents of the
`out/linux/lifecycle/` directory, for the given (or default) `LIFECYCLE_VERSION`.

```bash
$ make package
```
